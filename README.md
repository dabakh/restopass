Installing Prestashop

   -  Download and unzip the PrestaShop package if you haven't already.
   -  Create a database for PrestaShop shop on your web server if it is possible. In case there is no MySQL user who 
      has all   privileges for accessing and modifying this database, create it as well.
   -  Upload the PrestaShop files and folders to the chosen location on your web server. 
      Do not upload the root /prestashop  folder directly: only the files and folders that it contains.
   -  Run the PrestaShop installation script by accessing the public URL for the chosen location in a web browser. 
   -  This should be the URL where you uploaded the PrestaShop files.
   -  Follow the instructions on each screen of the installer.
   -  Once the installation is done, delete the /install folder and write down the new of the /admin folder, 
      which has been generated in order to be unique to you, for security reasons.
